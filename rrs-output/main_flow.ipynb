The channel would connect a new upland cut marina to the existing channel adjacent to the Mid-Bay Bridge. Up to 10 channel markers would be installed along the new channel. Two jetties constructed from sheet pile and riprap covering 5500 sqft of bay bottom would be installed at landward end of the channel. Dredging and jetties would impact a total of 9008 sqft (0.21-acre) of SAV. The basin for the new upland cut marina would involve mechanically excavating 176581 cu yards of material from 306563 sqft of uplands and ponds. The 1302-foot-long upland cut would also be used as a settling basin during the channel dredging and would not be opened to Choctawhatchee Bay until that dredging is complete and turbidity levels have reduced. Dredged material would first be discharged into a bermed Dredge Material Management Area located in uplands, with excess slurr\n",
