The applicant has received authorization from the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board (MOGB) to re- enter the Yelverton #1 well in an attempt to locate another possible productive zone from which to extract oil and gas mineral res ources. In order to prepare the subject well pad and site access road to complete this work, the applicant has proposed a dual phase approach to this program. Initially, the applicant is seeking concurrent written authorization from the U .S. Army Corps o f Engineers (USACE), Nationwide Permit program (NWP) for the proposed \"temporary\" impacts for temporary activities within the portions of the project area that have wetlands. Upon verification under the NMP program, Spooner will initially cut small trees and saplings within the existing access road and within the former well pad area. The western access road dimensions are +/ -1,487- feet x +. -12-feet wide. The current well pad area is 200- feet x 150 ?feet.Trees and saplings wil l be cut close to ground level and sidecast along access road and on side of well pad. Trees and saplings will be picked up and removed at the conclusion of the project.A temporary culvert [48- inch x 30- foot] will be placed in the existing unnamed tributary creek located about 1, 150-feet east of the well pad. Silt fencing, b ooms, straw wattles, and other siltation manag ement controls will be placed on the north and south sides of the culvert and ditch crossing. A geotextile fabric will then be placed along the access road and well pad area, followed by placement of timber mats measuring 12-feet wide by 6- inches thick .NO other temporary fill will be added to or taken from this area.No excavations or drill pits will be required during these activities.These activities should take no more than 2 weeks to complete. Well re-entry will th en commence and should take no more than 4 to 5 weeks to complete.If unsuccessful, the timber mats, geotextile fabric material, limestone gravel and culvert will be remo ved from the project are a. Silt fencing and other erosion and siltation BMPs will remain in place during this entire phase of work.All work will remain within the previously impacted areas. However, if the planne d well re -entry program provides a productive well, Spooner is requesting the current permit proposal to address permanent impacts a ssociated with fully developing the western site access road and the well pad area. This portion of the applicant?s proposal is the following requested permit activity associated with this notice . Current proposal -The applicant proposes to permanently fill 1.16 acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands for the construction of a well pad and access road , and 30 feet of an unnamed tributary to the Tallahoma Creek for construction of a culverted crossing. Well Pad -The existing well pad area is approximately 200- feet x 150- feet (0.69 acre) . Approximately 1,850 cubic yards of local fill will be brought in to fill an area of the well pad(+/-220-feet x 150- feet x 1.5 feet thick) contoured with the existing slope.This will be an extension of the well pad by 20- feet to the south to ensure space for all future flow through process equipment (i. e., heater treaters, well head, tanks, etc.). Total impacts to the new well site will require 0.75 acres of impact to bottomland hardwood wetlands . Access Road -Approximately 990 cubic yards of local fill will also be required to shore up the western access road from the well pad back to the former logging road staging area.The measurement of the access road within wetlands measures 1,487- feet x 12- feet x 1.5 feet .The remaining upland portion of the road measures 1,189 x 12- feet x 1.5 feet (0.32 acres) . The permanent access road will permanently impact 0.41 acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands. Culverted Crossing -The temporary culverted crossing would remain as a permanent structure. The culvert [48- inch x 30- foot] will remain placed in an unnamed tributary creek located about 1,150- feet east of the well pad. The temporary crossing consists of a geotextile fabric placed along the access road and well pad area, followed by placement of timber mats measuring 12- feet wide by 6- inches thick .The temporary oak mat boards used will be removed and replaced with 1.0? -1.5 will be placed on the existing underlayment of geotextile fabric. The crossing will require placement of approximately 15 cu yards of limestone gravel on sides and on top of the culvert. Trees and saplings wil be cut close to the ground and temporarily sidecast along the access road and side of well pad. Trees and saplings will be picked up and removed at the conclusion of the project. Silt fencin g, booms, straw wattles, and other siltation manag ement controls will be placed on the north and south sides of the culvert and ditch crossing. BMP's fill placement will consist of silt fencing and hay bales along the sides of the well pad and site access road to minimize siltation. Seeding of the periphery of the well pad will also be evaluated at the conclusion of the re- entry program to assess the need for soil stabilization around the well pad.If natural revegetation begins to take place, then re- seeding will not be necessary.All production fluids and liquids will be maintained in secured/contained tanks and containers within the established project area.No additional areas outside of the well pad will be required for fill placement, equipment staging, etc. Mitigation -Mitigation for the permanent impacts proposed will consist of the possible purchase of mitigation credits from a Wetlands Mitigation Bank in the g eneral area and/or other considerations consisting of, but not limited to, possible stream bank restoration in the area, restoration/enhancement of an impacted well site in the immediate area of the Yelverton #1 well site, o r other possible permi ttee responsible mitigation to demonstrate that there has been a sufficient amount of functional lift to another area to compensate for impacts resulting from the proposed activities.\n\nExtracted Data: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'wetlands': [{'wetland_type': 'bottomland hardwood', 'impact_quantity': '1.16', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'permanent', 'impact_type': 'fill'}]}"}]}

CULTURAL RESOURCES : The Corps has determined that the permit area has been extensively modified by previous work and there is little likelihood that an historic property may be affected . ENDANGERED SPECIES: The Corps made determinations on the following species: West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), Kemp\u2019s ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempii), Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), Smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) Basis for determination(s): West Indian manatee: The project site is located in an Important Manatee ( Trichechus manatus ) area. The Corps has made the determination that the proposed project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect (MANLAA) , the West Indian manatee and its designated critical habitat. Since the proposal by the applicant is for in- water construction, potential impacts to the endangered manatee were evaluated using The Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, and the State of Florida Effect Determination Key for the Manatee in Florida (Manatee Key), dated April 2013.Use of the Manatee Key resulted in the following sequential determination: A>B>C>D>E >N>O>P>3 with further consultation necessary for MANLAA. The Corps will req uest Fish and Wildlife Service concurrence with this determination pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Smalltooth sawfish and sea turtles: The Corps evaluated the proposed work utilizing NMFS\u2019s Jacksonville District\u2019s Programmatic Biological Opinion (JAXBO) dated 20 November 2017. The JAXBO analyzes the effects from 10 categories of minor in- water activities occurring in Florida and the U.S. Caribbean on sea turtles (loggerhead, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, hawksbill, and green); smalltooth sawfish; Nassau grouper; scalloped hammerhead shark, Johnson's seagrass; sturgeon (Gulf, shortnose, and Atlantic); corals (elkhorn, staghorn, boulder star, mountainous star, lobed star, rough cactus, and pillar); whales (North Atlantic right whale, sei, blue, fin, and sperm); and designated critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass; smalltooth sawfish; sturgeon (Gulf 2 and Atlantic); sea turtles (green, hawksbill, leatherback, loggerhead); North Atlantic right whale; and elkhorn and staghorn corals in accordance with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Based on past permitting practices of the Corps and review of consultations with similar in- water construction activities, Project Design Criteria (PDCs) were identified in the JAXBO that typically have been applied to permitted in- water construction activities. These PDCs ensure effects of in- water construction activities are minimal in nature and do not result in adverse effects to listed species or to essential features of designated CH. For this verification, the Corps conducted a project specific review to ensure that all of the PDCs were met. In accordance with the project -specific review process established in the JAXBO, a PDC checklist, certification that the activity meets the applicable PDCs, and supporting documentation for the proposed activity were emailed to nmfs.ser.statewideprogrammatic@noaa.gov and jaxbo@usace.army.mil on 08 September 2020 Activity 3: M aintenance Dredging. For Activity 2: Pile Supported Structure, on 08 September 2020 the Corps sent NMFS a request to supersede the standard JAXBO PDCs to allow the project to exceed the 50-slip minimum .Therefore, the Jacksonville District satisfied the project -specific review requirements stipulated in the JAXBO and satisfied its obligation under the ESA for the above- listed species and critical habitats within the NMFS purview. ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT (EFH):This notice initiates consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service on EFH as required by the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Cons ervation and Management Act 1996. The proposal would impact approximately 17,039 square feet of estuarine or marine habitat utilized by various life stages of Penaeid Shrimp Complex , Red Drum(Sciaenops ocellatus ), Reef fish (various spp.) , Stone Crab ( Menippe mercenaria) , Spiny Lobster ( Panulirus argus ), Migratory/Pelagic fish (various spp.) , Snapper/Grouper Complex.Our initial determination is that the proposed action would not have a substantial adverse impact on EFH or Federally managed fisheries i n the Estero Bay. Our final determination relative to project impacts and the need for mitigation measures is subject to review by and coordination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.

Wetland impacts would include 37.38 acres of permanent impact and 2.78 acres of temporary impacts. The project is known as the Ridge Road Extension (RRE). The project consists of three segments that include Phase I, an interchange with the Suncoast Parkw ay, and Phase I I. Phase I would be located west of the Suncoast Parkway interchange and would consist of a 4\u00adlane divided roadway that is approximately 4.2 miles in length. The proposed roadway would intersect the Suncoast Parkway approximately 3.2 miles south of SR -52 at an existing overpass.A full diamond interchange and approximately 1 mile of 4- lane divided roadway would be constructed within the limits of the interchange.Phase II would be located east of the Suncoast Parkway interchange and would consist of 4 -lane divided roadway that is 3.44 miles in length. An additional 2.78 acres of wetlands/waters are proposed to be temporarily filled/impacted to facilitate construction of the roadway, including bridges. Temporary fill material and/or temporary structures, such as drain pipes, coffer dams, etc. , would be removed upon completion of construction and the area would be returned to pre- construction contours and 2hydrologic conditions. Best management practices, such as underlying temporary fill with geotextile, would be incorporated to minimize impacts and ensure clean removal of temporary fill material. Previous iterations of this project proposed Phase II as a limited access roadway, allowing only one access point to a commercial parcel located on the east side of the interchange. The applicants now propose to design Phase II as an arterial roadway that would allow as many as seven (7) signalized intersections (also referred to as \u201cfull movement intersections\u201d) between the Suncoast Parkway and Land O\u2019Lakes Boulevard (US-41). This public notice is being published primarily due to this change in status of Phase II. The precise number and location of potential intersections is not yet known and the applicants are not seeking authorization for any impacts to waters of the United States that may be associated with these potential intersections or associated developments .Pasco County has stated that developers would be responsible for obtaining authorizations for any impacts to waters of the United States beyond those currently proposed for construction of the Ridge Road Extension.

The site would be referred to as Deer Island Habitat Restoration (DIHR) and is located approximately 2,200 linear feet to the west of Deer Island Marsh Restoration Two (DIMR2). The proposed project would include creation of approximately 1,975 linear feet of a coastal chenier (upland ridge) along the existing coastline and the southern boundary of the project site, and an outer berm, 4,520 feet in length, would be constructed along the proposed northern boundary of the project site and would run parallel to the north shoreline of Deer Island then curve south on the western most end to connect back to the Island. The outer berm and coastal chenier would be constructed from material on-site, dredged and placed mechanically. Sand dredged from the Black Warrior-Tombigbee Rivers would then be placed hydraulically to reinforce the outside of the berm. The outer berm would be constructed on the -4 feet MLLW contour and would be raised toSeptember 21, 2018 Page 2of5 an elevation of +6 feet MLLW. The interior coastal Chenier would be raised to an elevation of +4 feet MLLW. The eastern end of the containment berm would remain open to provide for tidal flushing as well as continuation of the marsh adjacent to Grand Bayou. Dredged material from various local dredging projects in Harrison and Jackson Counties would be placed within the 70-acre bermed site over the 10-year period. All dredged material would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for suitability of use within the BU site, through each individual permitting process. Within the disposal area, the dredged material would be pumped to a height of +3 to +5 MLLW initially, with final grade after dewatering and consolidation ranging from -0.5 to +1.5 MLLW. Two access channels located on the eastern and western side of the proposed site, would be dredged to -9 feet MLLW if needed for access. These channels would be placed in such a manner as to avoid existing reefs in the area. The channels would extend to a depth sufficient to allow barge access and not exceed 2,500 linear feet in length. Both access channels would need to be maintained for the 10-year life of the permit, or until capacity is reached. The material removed during the initial channel dredging would be side cast to the immediate west side of the channel in order to renourish the island. Any material removed during maintenance dredging over the 10-year life of the project, would be pumped into the BU site. The site would accept material incrementally for the life of the permit or until capacity is reached. Depending on the composition of the material placed into the site, the anticipated capacity would be between 470,000 and 575,000 cubic yards. The outside berm and interior marsh would be planted with appropriate marsh and dune species when construction and dewatering are complete. EXISTING CONDITIONS: Deer Island is a near shore island located just off the mainland of Biloxi, Harrison County, Mississippi. Deer Island is not considered a barrier island but rather an extension of the mainland geological structure. It is a Coastal Preserve comprised of approximately 650 acres. Most of the lands are owned, managed, and monitored by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources. Habitat within the Preserve is comprised of Mississippi Sound sand bottoms, barrier island pond/lagoon complex, polyhaline marsh, mesohaline marsh, slash pine maritime forest, and relic dune scrub. Sediment surrounding the island is composed mostly of fine-grained sands, silty sands, and sands. A shellfish and SAV survey were conducted on August 29, 2017. No shellfish or SAV were found within the project boundary. PROJECT PURPOSE: As stated by the applicant, \"The beneficial use law in Mississippi (MS Code \u00a7 49-27-61) requires that all suitable dredged material, from projects greater than 2,500 cubic yards, be used beneficially. To comply with the law, the Beneficial Use of Dredged Material Program (BU) needs to have adequate capacity to accept dredged material from current and future dredging projects. Currently, Deer Island Marsh Restoration 2(DIMR2) is the only site in Harrison County that can accept dredged material and it is expected to be at capacity by December 31, 2018. Round Island and Greenwood Island, in Jackson County, are currently at capacity and expected to be at capacity by December 2018, respectively. Restored marshes protect shorelines fromwave energy while also performing environmental functions, such as increasing water quality, promoting settlement of suspended particulates, and providing habitat to various species of birds, fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates. Restoration projects like that proposed, are critical to preserve and enhance vital habitats provided by Deer Island.\" Additional review will be performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and cooperating agencies.\n\nExtracted Data: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'wetlands': [{'wetland_type': 'open water', 'impact_quantity': '70', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'fill as Beneficial Use'}]}"}]}

The excavated mat erial would be temporarily side cast during the pipe placement and once the pipeline is in place the material would be replaced over the top of the pipeline.A total of 40,000 cubic yards of sediments would be excavated and t hen backfilled into the trench once the pipes are installed.Concrete mats would be placed over the pipes and backfill at critical areas.The same equipment used to excavate the trench would be used to cover it up.The excavated material would be side cast rather 5than lifting the mat erial completely out of the water to avoid suspending sediments throughout the entire water column.By keeping the material near the seafloor, it would keep the turbidity plumes near the uncolonized seafloor and sparsely colonized lower area of the channel walls.Keeping the material in the water also avoids having the material dewater while waiting to re- fill the trench.The excavation within the channel would be made so the top of the pipelines would be at minimum depth of 70 feet below mean sea level, so they would be at least 10feet below the existing channel floor which is 60feet below mean sea level.The fourth section of the pipelines would begin o nce the pipelines emerge from the channel .This section of the pipelines w ould be surface lain to a depth of 150 feet where the PLEM would be placed.The PLEM would be held in place by four 18 inchesdiameter piles which would be 60 feet in length.A submarine vibra- hammer on a crane barge would be used to install these pilings .The system w ould then transition into three 24 inchesin diameter hoses which w ould be suspended mid water at a depth of 150feet to 250 feet to the Buoy Balance Position for the SPM.Floats and weights would be used to hold the hoses in position and eightanchors would be used to stabilize the SPM in a position at 665 feet of water depth , which would allow for adequate depth for the tankers to swing without getting in to water less than 88 feet.Three anchors may be placed on the floated hoses if nec essary.The hose anchors and the SPM anchors would be anchor piles 60 inches in diameter and 80 feetin length.A submarine vibra- hammer on a crane barge would be used to install these pilings.The SPM would be placed in an area of restricted navigation.The PLEM hoses and SPM would be illuminated to allow for clear visibility of these structures.The sinking of the pipeline in place would be controlled by a crane on a barge, removal of floats and flooding of the pipe.Pipe sink divers and/or robots would assist and would bolt the pipeline sections together.The final pipeline route would be marked prior to the start of construction. The construction footprint of trenched sections of the pipeline would be approximately 62feet wide.The applicant isproposing to relocate all coralcolonie s located within 50 feet of the centerline of trenched sections of thepipeline corridor.For surface lain sections of the pipeline the applicant estimates an impact area of approximately 11 feet wide and is proposi ng to relocate all coral colonies located within 20 feet from the centerline of the pipeline corridor.An estimated total of 2 ,215 coral colonies would be relocated from the project corri dor.Those c oral colonies would be relocated to the east of their current location, outside of the project construction or impact corridor .According to applicant estimates, the project impact corridor would occupy an area of approximately 4.33 acres of marine bottom, of which approximately 1 .65 acres would consist of p avement or hardbottom areassupporting the essential features of Acroporaspp.6\n\nExtracted Data: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'wetlands': [{'wetland_type': 'unknown', 'impact_quantity': '4.33', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'loss'}]}"}]}

The purpose of this project as stated by the applicant is to create approximately 175 acres of marsh habitatin an area referred to as Railroad Corner. The proposed project would be c onstructed within an180-acreproject site currently consisting of shallow, open water habitat with wate r depths which vary from -1 to -5.5 feet Mean lower low water (MLLW). The proposed si te is located within the Mississippi Sound east of the mouth of the West Pascagoula River with marsh systems located to the east and west, the CSX Railroad bridge located to the north running between Gautier and Pascagoula. During a survey completed inSeptember 2022, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) was located along the we stern portion of the project ar ea. SAV was present from theedge of the marsh to approximat ely 15 feet waterward. Total acreage equals approximately 1.44 acres. No shellfish were observed withi n the project area during the survey.The project components would include the construc tion of three berms to hold approximately966,000 cubic yards of dredged material to suppor t the creation of appr oximately 175 acres of coastal marsh. An earthen berm would be c onstructed on the western side of the project area to preserve existing SAV habitat,a v egetated berm would be constructed along the eastern portion of the proposed site, and a rock berm would be constructed along the southern extent of t he project area.Rock Berm: An approximately 1,365 linear foot rock berm with a crest elevation of +6.2 feet MLLW would be construct ed along the southern ex tent of the project area. A 60-foot gap would remain between the western marsh and the western end of the proposed rock berm to allow for continued flow to the ar ea containing SAV along t he western portion of the project site. Two 30-foot gaps would be pl aced within the rock be rm to allow for tidal exchange and fish passage. Approximately 926 s quare feet of brackish marsh would be covered at the eastern tie- in of the rock berm.Vegetated Berm : An approximately 1,325 linear f oot vegetated berm with a maximum width of 55 feet and a crest elevation of +4.0 feet MLLW would be placed to reinforce a thin section of existing marsh on the eas tern side of the project areaEarthen BermAn approximately 3,500 linear footearthen berm with a proposed crest elevation of +2 feet mean lower low water (M LLW) would be constructed to protect existing SAV habitat located along the western side of the project area. The earthen berm would tie into the western end of the rock berm and ex tend to the northern boundary, paralleling the shoreline and providing a minimum 25-foot open water buffer for the SAV. This would create a tidal creek which would provide ti dal flow and fish access to any naturally occurring tidal creeks within the created marsh located on the eastern side of the earthen berm. In addition to preserving the existing h abitat, the establishmentof the earthen berm could provide additional habitat for existing SAV along its western boundary.Marsh habitatelevations would vary between -0.5 feet to +3 feet MLLW =+0 .2 to +3.7 feet NAVD88) with a target elevation of +1.0-foot MLLW (+ 1.7 feet NAVD88). Marsh planting is not anticipated as a component ofthe project. Due to the proximity of existing healthy marsh in the area, natural recruitment is ant icipated to provide seeding of the newly created BU areas. Juncus roemerianus (black needlerush) and Spartina alterniflora(smooth cordgrass) are two common marsh species k nown to exist in adjacent marshes and would be likely volunteers for recruitment to t he newly constructed beneficial use cells.Access channels : Due to the shallow depths in the vi cinity of the proposed berms, various construction access channels are proposed. A c onstruction access channel is proposed on the south side of the rock berm with an appr oach channel from t he mouth of Railroad Corner. Depending on site conditions, the construction channel may be located on the north side of the proposed rock berm. Access channels within the site along the westernearthen berm and to the eastern vegetated be rm may also be required for construction access. Access channels would be dredged to a bottom elevation of -6.7 foot, NAVD88 (-6.0 feet, MLLW) with a bottom width of 50 fee t. Dredged material from the channels wouldbe placed within the benef icial use site, for construction of the earthen berm, or for construction of the vegetated berm. The applicantstated that no mitigation measures were proposed as the project would create appr oximately 175 acres of marsh habitat.\n\nExtracted Data: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'wetlands': [{'wetland_type': 'marsh', 'impact_quantity': '175', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'beneficial use'}, {'wetland_type': 'submerged aquatic vegetation', 'impact_quantity': '1.44', 'impact_unit': 'acres', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'loss'}, {'wetland_type': 'brackish marsh', 'impact_quantity': '926', 'impact_unit': 'square feet', 'impact_duration': 'unknown', 'impact_type': 'loss'}]}"}]}
